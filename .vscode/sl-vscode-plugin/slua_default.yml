The dataserver callback will be executed with the key returned from this call and a string describing the result. The result is a two element commma-delimited list. The first item is an integer specifying if the transaction succeeded (1) or not (0). In the failure case, the second item will be an integer corresponding to one of the XP_ERROR_... constants. In the success case the second item will be the value associated with the key. If Checked is 1 the existing value in the data store must match the OriginalValue passed or XP_ERROR_RETRY_UPDATE will be returned.
